                        <p>We may amend this agreement at any time by posting the amended terms on <strong>www.DrNajeebLectures.com</strong>our site (the "site"). Except as stated below, all amended terms shall be effective 30 days after they are initially posted on our site. Upcoming changes will also be posted on this page.</p>
                        <p>In this agreement, "you" or "your" means any person or entity subscribing to and/or using the service ("users"). Unless otherwise stated, "DrNajeebLectures," "we," or "our" will refer collectively to <strong>www.DrNajeebLectures.com</strong>.</p>
                        <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING USE, CONDITIONS, AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE SUBSCRIBING TO OUR MATERIAL.</p>
                        <p><strong>License</strong></p>
                        <p>In consideration of and subject to your payment of the appropriate subscription fee for the services you subscribe to, and your agreement to and compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement, <strong>www.DrNajeebLectures.com</strong> grants to you a non-exclusive, non-sub licensable, non-transferable license, and right to use and access the <strong>www.DrNajeebLectures.com</strong> content (the "licensed materials") from multiple places/locations/computers at "different times." You are not allowed to access the <strong>www.DrNajeebLectures.com</strong> content from multiple places/locations/computers at "same" time. Agreeing to the terms of this agreement includes the following:</p>
                        <p><strong>System Requirements</strong></p>
                        <p>You have to use a <strong>www.DrNajeebLectures.com</strong> recommended version of operating system, Internet browser and any other required softwares to access the licensed materials.</p>
                        <p>We suggest Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome as your web browser.</p>
                        <p><strong>Access to Course Content</strong></p>
                        <p>You shall be allowed to use the licensed materials for the specific package(s) and matter to which you have subscribed. Each package has its own subscription fees and duration.</p>
                        <p><strong>Order</strong></p>
                        <p>Most of the information collected in the registration process will be used to process orders. During the order process, you will have to provide financial information such as your credit/debit card number, expiration date, CVV2 code, payee name and billing address. This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill your order. To properly process your credit/debit card information, we must share your personal and financial information with the merchant bank for authorization and approval. This process is protected by an enhanced security system. We do not share your personal and financial information with any third parties, except those specified in Privacy policy.</p>
                        <p>When you attempt a transaction on our website, your credit/debit card is not actually charged at that moment. The card processor checks with your card issuer to first make sure you have enough available funds to complete the purchase. At that time, your card issuer places a hold, or pending charge, on the amount of the intended transaction against your card. The card processor then makes sure the other info you input (for instance, your address, CVV2 Code, expiration date, etc.) is correct, and if all is well the transaction is processed. If not, such as if you enter an incorrect address or other associated detail, then the transaction is declined. This is NOT a situation unique with this website, but it is how virtually all online transactions are handled. Typically it takes the card issuing bank 2-5 days to clear associated pending charges resulting from failed/declined attempts.</p>
                        <p>We charge for each successful transaction attempt and provide a confirmation of such on our website and send a confirmation email to the registered email address upon each successful transaction on our website.</p>
